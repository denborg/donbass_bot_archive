{"Malefic Drake's Strike": "Through the combination of the right sequence of spells and a great amount of suffering--both on his part and that of many trial victims--Viper has at last grown confident his augmentations will allow him to return to the Nether Reaches and reign as the most toxic creature alive. Though the way has long been sealed, rumors speak of one passage between the realms that might still exist, somewhere deep in the abyss. All he has to do is find it.",
"Astral Drift": "Harbinger seeks a swift end to the trifling struggle between Radiant and Dire not for the sake of power, but from a sense at the edge of his consciousness that the war of the Ancients itself might serve as catalyst for the arrival of another, darker force.",
"Bracers of Forlorn Precipice": "Though he uses his powers in battle unflinchingly and without pause, Ish'Kafel silently yearns to do more than just grasp and manipulate the tendrils of his home.

"Paragon's Rebuke": "The forgemaster of Emauracus boasts he's the finest smith alive. Some allow he may be right. Yet even he can only marvel at the enchanted works of the old ones--those long-dead knights who were amongst the first mortals to receive the blessings of the Omniscience.",

"Edge of the Lost Order": "Long before Yurnero's time, just before the apex of the Isle of Masks, a new school of Mastery emerged--one whose practitioners had learned to use their blades to pierce the very fabric of reality itself. But soon these blademasters found the repercussions of such actions could spread far beyond the field of battle. Fearing dire outcomes--the nature of which we know little about--the elders of the school burned every scrap of parchment in their libraries before turning their blades upon all of the school's adherents...and eventually themselves.",
"The Order of Cyprin": "Slithice was barely a cycle into her first deployment with the Guard, and still without thoughts of a command of her own, when she was sent with a Slithereen battalion to aid the Conclave at the Battle of Stonefish Gate. For her valor in the face of gravest threat, and against her protestations otherwise, she would earn the highest honors awarded to one of her kind, gaining acceptance into an ancient order, and setting a course for her rise to preeminence.",
"Leviathan Whale Blade of Eminent Revival": "Issued to the Admiral of the Claddish Navy to commemorate The International 2013, this legendary blade featured a dramatic new animation for Kunkka's Torrent ability, a change in style that would lead the way for all Immortals to come.",
"Cult of Aktok": "Following a particularly injurious victory, the Venomancer slithered into a crack in the earth, to coil around himself and focus on regaining full strength. But his chosen place of rest had a much older purpose. It was there that the worshippers of Aktok, an ancient serpent god destined to swallow the world, would gather once each season to offer sacrifice in Aktok's name. Mistaken for a herald of their lord, Venomancer was content to receive the offerings directly...until his strength returned, and he could trail the shamans back to their village for a much larger meal.",
"Axia of Metira": "It is said that Axia of Metira had only submitted to a single rider in the span of her many years -- long ago taking aloft with the Goddess Selemene herself.

"Censer of Gliss": "When the mobs in pursuit at last grew too large to justify slaughter, and word of his frequent reprisals had attracted powerful foes, Rhasta ventured deep into the earth, guided by something he could not name. But even in the darkest caverns, he would find those covetous of his gifts. Where he sought kinship, strife would always follow. But a part of him seemed at home in the dark, and when a lordly serpent priest raised a cursed decanter to strike him down, Rhasta vowed to retreat no more.",
"The Spoils of Dezun": "Few in the Order of Dezun know the true source of the ingredients used to attempt a journey into the Nothl realm.

"Hell-Spar Anathema": "Forced to his knees before the altar of his own temple, Prelate Vidmar, head of the Order of the Crystal Echelon, knew vile hatred. His flock--acolytes and supplicants alike--lay in pieces around him. As the creature--it could not be called a man--raised its demonic hand once more, the Prelate focused on the fire of his own rage. With final breath, as Lion's dreadful power crashed into his body, Vidmar cursed the Demon Witch. Strengthened by the arcane conduit of the Demon Witch's spell, the Prelate's curse surged into Lion's hand, corrupting it with Crystal Rot. Only by fusing the Prelate's modified headpiece to the afflicted flesh was Lion able to slow the creep of crystalline blight...and a time will come when a more permanent solution must be found.",

"Etienne's Revenge": "In the battle waged by the Gallants against King Sylak's pyromancers, there was but one survivor.

"Pyrexaec Floe": "The Mer still tell tales of the dreadful night, when a raiding party of the finest Slithereen warriors returned with only two survivors. As each found the words, they warned of a two-headed demon that protected the bluffs of Grosche. At first the sea itself had saved the marauders from the lancing flames of one vile head.

The two survivors could only watch as their fellows were frozen in place atop icy waves, helpless to escape the renewed assault of cleansing fire.",
"Concord Dominion": "For Azwraith, there could be no return to Pole. Though his people would welcome him with open arms, a fisherman's life offered no place for his new phantom kin.

"Yulsaria's Mantle": "In an age now lost to time, the Frozen Witch Yulsaria ruled the whitelands, summoning blizzards and hail storms upon those who displeased her, while an army of ice golems roamed the lands to snuff out all warmth. In time, her southward expansion angered the Eldwurm Slyrak who, in his terrible rage, melted Yulsaria's armies with his endless flame before conquering the Frozen Witch herself. Now, centuries later, shifts in the ice have uncovered yet another shard of her empire: her frosty mantle. ",

For Treant Protector, however, the sproutlings are a bit of harmless company whose vines offer a patch of thorny armor on his flanks.",
"Prize of the Saltworn Mariner": "When he was just a lowly midshipman, and a young boy first at sea, the stories were meant to frighten. Whole fleets lost to a razortooth pointer--measuring longer than a frigate and twice as fast--hunting for sailors in their ships like a wolf seeks marrow in the bone. But Kunkka paid the tales no mind. He thought them mere rum-fueled scuttle, swapped to scare the cabin boys, and he had ranks to climb. It was only many years later, after he earned his gold-laced buttons and half his legend hunting and killing such a beast, that he truly understood...there are always bigger fish in the sea.",

"Molten Claw": "In a rush to lay his enemies down, Axe burst into a forge to scrounge for suitable armor. What he found was still fresh from the fire, which suited Axe just fine. Includes ambient particle.",
"Bloodfeather Wings": "The ravens who feast upon the corpses of the cursed oft grow vile and monstrous. From horror devoured was woven a span worthy of agony's mistress. Includes ambient particle.",
"Fluttering Staff": "So gentle was the prophet that when he pulled the branch to make this staff, the butterflies upon the leaves remained. Includes ambient particle.",
"Empyrean": "'Tis told among Skywrath-kind the legend of Shaldera, a being of black wing who in hubris flew into the darker skies hoping to meet the heavenly lords above. She who returned did so upon golden feathers, bearing the divine spear Empyrean, a symbol of her flight. It is said her kingdom endured for a thousand years and one.",
"Swift Claw": "You may flee from his rage. You may leave his echoing roar far behind. And you may think yourself safe, perhaps in a clearing or canyon, with no sign of your pursuer. Then, suddenly, his claws find you, and it is the last you know.",
"Soul Diffuser": "By this blade shall you know her, bringer of death, bearer of your final moments of mortal terror.  She who renders your soul diffuse, your body lifeless dark, mere meat and viscera.  In a flash of movement, she slices your soul's tether, and frees you to learn the truth of the last great mystery.",
"Flourishing Lodestar": "In the shade of the first trees, water runs clear, and the earth radiates a gentle warmth. The spirits of the verdant wild coil about, endlessly mending, and eternally twisting old life into new. From the boughs of these elder saplings was carved the Lodestar, a tool to aid nature's benevolent servants so that they may guide, heal, and preserve all that must be held dear.",
"Severing Crest": "To face the guardians of the Narrow Maze is to deny eternity itself. Yet there are those who would dare defy their fate and strike at the source of their torment, only to be thrown down time and again. These insolent few may soon find themselves flung to the darkest reaches of the herebetween, and left to wander fateless, for all eternity.",
"Lamb to the Slaughter": "Invented long ago as a way to combat insomnia, this spell will have you counting sheep in no time.  Provided you can only count to one.  With a wave of his wand, Shadow Shaman can clad even the deadliest wolf in sheep's clothing.",
"Blade of Tears": "Just as Morphling exists on two planes at once--both terrene and astral--the blade of tears is a weapon of extreme versatility, both ethereal and not.  Only the tears of the slain are real.",
"Eternal Machine Head": "Tis a poor tradesman who blames his tools, but when your tradecraft is warfare, your tools take on a particular importance.  For this reason, Rattletrap long ago set out to transform himself into a the greatest tool of warfare that the keen folk had ever known.  Constantly improving himself over the course of many years, he has now finally reached the pinnacle of destructive power, stepping onto the battlefield as the Eternal Machine.",
"Gravelmaw": "That which the strength of earth may create, the strength of earth may destroy, chewed into dust by shifting rock. Where once, in a time before knowledge of time, great stone giants built their cities, now lies an endless sea of pebbles. At its center yawns a great fissure, filled with the gravel remains of the countless many. Only a single segment of a single pillar remains to mark a grave for this ancient civilization.",
"Crystal Dryad": "Had the ancient mage but known what corruption his scepter would inflict upon the world, he would have burned and buried it, and sown salt over its cursed grave.  For when carried in a fist of stone, Aghanim's scepter unleashes the spirit of the Crystal Dryad, and no foe is safe.",
"White Sentry": "The construction of a ward is considered a rite of passage for any aspiring artificer of magical goods. Though her interests eventually turned toward combat sorcery, Rylai discovered early that she had the skill required to become a talented artificer.",
"Mania's Mask": "To wander the woods knowing you are alone, an orphan of those who birthed you, rejected by those who raised you, hidden from those who might give warmth and comfort... this is a path to madness.",
"Geodesic Eidolon": "Not all eidolons are created equal.  Some are forged of strange gravities in the dark heart of the universe where even light cannot escape.  Like lines across curved space, they provide the shortest distance to your enemy's death.",
"Elixir of Dragon's Breath": "Fermented from the concentrate of thousand-year-old Dragon's blood, this rare elixir is guaranteed to put hair on your chest.  And then set fire to that hair.   ",
"Pale Mausoleum": "The dirge howls from the deep. Its call is irresistible, its song a melody of dark and cold. All will fall under the spell, be they tyrant or peasant, soldier or thief. The dirge shall claim.",
"Inverse Bayonet": "A weapon long-rumored but rarely seen.  Designed for those most dangerous times when even your sword absolutely must be armed. ",
"Fluttering Mortis": "The Death Prophet Krobelus flutters beyond the veil of the world, peering into realms best unseen.  At her back, flutters death itself, while in her veins pulses the dark ink of all her prophecies still unwritten.",
"Yulsaria's Glacier": "In the frigid north, that which is lost to myth may still be found within the ice. In an age now lost to time, the Frozen Witch Yulsaria ruled the whitelands, summoning blizzards and hail storms upon those who displeased her, while an army of ice golems roamed the lands to snuff out all warmth. In time, her southward expansion angered the Eldwurm Slyrak who, in his terrible rage, melted Yulsaria's armies with his endless flame before conquering the Frozen Witch herself. Now, centuries later, shifts in the ice have heaved up the last remaining shard of her empire: her glacial crown.",
"Sylvan Cascade": "A cape woven from the finest wind-strewn filaments of enchanted ephemera, this is a garment of both rare beauty and unexpected utility.  For she who wears the cape of the Sylvan Cascade, the wind will be always at her back.",
"Merry Wanderer's Brush": "Beneath the magic moonless night sprout sights rare-seen by mortal man: the swaying sweep of faerie flight unfurls to gorgeous shimmering span. And from this beauteous wonder light of shifting hue there might be spied, yet those who seek such perilous views may oft then find their lives denied.",
"Rampant Outrage": "Let them swing their puny swords and cast their pitiful spells. Let them scar the flesh and blacken the armor. Let them think they've found a weakness. Let them smile in their triumph. Then let them feel terror as the heavy blade ends their laughter.",
"Kindred of the Iron Dragon": "The blood of Slyrak flows strong through the Dragon Knight, and its transformative powers have long been a thing of legend.  For a chosen few who have received dragon blood, the magic runs unusually thick, its effects magnified and distorted.  In these rare recipients, the reach of the transformation is enhanced, drawing strength not from any single dragon but from the oldest ancestral strains, and a forgotten age when whole kingdoms shook with fear, and eyeless, armored dragons raged wars across the countryside.",
"The Lightning Orchid": "He who loudly speaks with silver tongue, in this helm wields silence golden.   Malevolence blooms like an orchid in the mind behind the mask.",
"Fin King's Charm": "Though once used by the Fin King's arcanists to dispatch his foes to the underwater realm, the core technique of the charm has since been lost, and much of its potency along with it.",
"Splattering Forcipule": "The darkest wilds of Jidi Isle are home to wondrous horrors. A distant relative to the Spitterpede family, the Splattering Forcipule can often be found growing in damp crevices or between the roots of trees. They will spend their entire lives bound to a single location, and the toxic venom they eject upon any creature foolish enough wander nearby is often more than sufficient to poison the hapless victim, as well as begin its digestion. Once this poor soul expires, their melting remains are quickly absorbed into the earth where they fall, allowing the Forcipule's subterranean root-tendrils to absorb the nutrients.",
"Hellborn Grasp": "A week of incantations were spent to pierce beyond the mortal realm and consort with what lay beyond. Finally, a sliver of infernal light appeared and from depths unknown rumbled a distant wail of suffering and anger. The wretched sound grew and grew into a deafening roar before a hellborn claw reached through the burning tear into the world. Yet in its unseeing fury the invading appendage disrupted the ritual, and the vile mouth from whence it sprang suddenly closed shut, forever severing the vile hand from its unknowable owner.",
"Muh Keen Gun": "Not content to kill things one bullet at a time, Sniper commissioned the best gunsmith in the land to construct him a firearm worthy of his talented trigger finger.  Lovingly designed and crafted with all the skill and attention to detail befitting a master smithy of the keen, the weapon that resulted is truly one for the ages.  It's a bit on the heavy side, true, but not when balanced against the weight of corpses it will produce.  Hernia not included.",
"Mecha Boots of Travel Mk III": "Why rely on uncertain sorcery when an unstable machine can be just as dangerous? Painstakingly reconstructed from half-remembered schematics, the transdimensional technologies built into these boots is theorized to have caused the Violet Plateau Incident. Of course, that couldn't possibly happen again. Er, could it?",
"Whalehook": "Ideally, a hook made for reeling in enormous creatures of the deep would not gouge and hack into the bones and flesh of the prey. But Pudge doesn't much care if he makes a mess of his meat.",
"Scree'auk's Talon": "Scree'auk's Talon was fashioned by a certain winged Mage, forged from shades of unrequited passion, tempered in grief, and quenched in the secret tears of her admirer. More's the pity that she uses it now, approximately half the time, to hunt him.",
"Leviathan Whale Blade": "Upon the rough seas swam the wondrous and terrible leviathan whale, set upon consuming ship and crew, and when it had eaten its fill did it vanish into the roiling waves leaving stranded those in its wake. Forged by one that lived, the blade ever seeks the heart of the beast.",
"Mace of the Chosen": "Weapons forged in the primal mists of the Font of Avernus may only be wielded by those the Font has chosen to defend it.",
"Cauldron of Xahryx": "Until at Sylla's paw the vile Xahryx fell asunder, the wildest power known was held within the cauldron's depths. In fear of what evil may seek such strength was the vessel taken, and put to heroic purpose.",
"Span of Black Nihility": "Beneath the wings of Black Nihility lies terrible darkness. Those in their shadow must supplicate and despair.",
"Alpine Stalker's Pants": "Lightweight pants designed to preserve the wearer's agility more than his hide.",
"Alpine Stalker's Scarf": "To the north of Ulfsaar's home-wood lies a nameless stretch of jagged, frozen peaks. On occaision the ursine people must range these mountains, culling the wild mountain beasts lest they grow and threaten the sleeping cubs.",
"Mandate of the Stormborn": "There are some who believe the surge of power that comes to Raijin Thunderkeg's hands is a natural result of any expenditure of his power. But no power comes without struggle, even for a Celestial. Though his skill allows for an effortless appearance, it is through sheer will alone that Raijin is able to harness the excess forces that flow from each jolt of his abilities.",
"Glaive of Oscilla": "Each orb on its own, when far removed from the other two, seemed nothing more than a mundane -- albeit perfectly shaped and polished -- stone sphere. Yet when the three stones were brought within proximity of one another, they began to vibrate so violently as to break the bones of anyone holding one. When a clever tinkerer devised mechanical means to bring the stones within a few paces of each other, the resulting shockwave left him and his hapless apprentice bleeding from the ears, and the stones nowhere to be found. It was only after they were much later recovered by the Aeol Drias that a more effective means of harnessing the power of the stones was discovered.",
"Orb of Deliverance": "His search led deep into the earth, down into ruins undisturbed by surface dwellers for millennia. Every scrap of evidence he'd found told him a greater, far older civilization had preceded those whose technologies he had already pilfered. But there were reasons no surface dwellers had come this far in ages, and Disruptor would need to modify his equipment with secrets found along the way just to ensure he might continue a bit further.",
"Crux of Perplex": "To Rubick's knowledge, not even the great Aghanim had discovered the surprisingly simple trick that could manipulate four-dimensional space in order to affect the happenings in his own.",
"Ghastly Nocturne": "Deep into the vitriol caves, the Rider's mount began to falter. With no chance at turning back, the only option was to push her failing body even further. Only through the intervention of an underkeen hermit met along the way was she saved from death's calling, endowed with augmentations that would speed her recovery... and grant access into depths previously unexplored.",
"Masque of Awaleb Bundle": "Though the origins of Zharvakko's brand of arcanism are somewhat murky, and largely apocryphal, the exploits of the influential healer Awaleb are known far and wide. In an age of famine, disease, and unending violence, Awaleb concluded that the ailments of his people amounted to mere symptoms of a much greater sickness. So he began to turn his legendary cauldron towards the dark arts of harm. His people could always trust his word and prescriptions, but his greater act of service to them was a willing corruption of sacred vows in the name of protection, and the twisted legacy he would leave behind.",
"Bonkers of Awaleb": "Though the origins of Zharvakko's brand of arcanism are somewhat murky, and largely apocryphal, the exploits of the influential healer Awaleb are known far and wide. In an age of famine, disease, and unending violence, Awaleb concluded that the ailments of his people amounted to mere symptoms of a much greater sickness. So he began to turn his legendary cauldron towards the dark arts of harm. His people could always trust his word and prescriptions, but his greater act of service to them was a willing corruption of sacred vows in the name of protection, and the twisted legacy he would leave behind.",
"Hearts of Misrule": "Though less verdant than her family's gardens in Roseleaf once were, Mireska soon found much to adore about the arid lands far to the southeast.",
"Sylvan Vedette": "Though the battle prowess of a tested ranger is never in doubt, it is the reconnaissance upon which one's tactics are based that allows for survival into yet another day.",
"Bloodfeather Feast": "The strike of Akasha's blade is boon to the unkind wings that eagerly await her torments from aloft.",
"Mask of the Confidant": "Though the Gallants act for the most part in the open -- and indeed enjoy the renown that follows in their wake -- sometimes a cause must be taken up in which secrecy serves not only to safeguard the interests of the Gallants, but also to lessen the dangers facing those who need their protection.",
"Tempest Revelation": "As his impulses once again got the better of his oath, and Zeus for a brief moment considered resignation to the prospects of a long mortal life, a new thought occurred to him. His wife had surely diminished his powers, but she had not cut him off from the source. He had already managed to regain some of his former glory. Perhaps with a bit of lordly resolution, he might tease the tendrils of divinity--infused into the endowments of Celestarr--towards his own hand once more.",
"Gimlek Decanter": "If the forgemaster of Grod had known his greatest blending of the mystical and martial arts--presented as holy tribute to, and bearing the royal sigil of, the King of Grod himself--would one distant day fall into the hands of a filthy ogre... Well, he likely wouldn't have bothered at all.",
"Tormented Staff of Eminent Revival": "The first weapon ever wielded by the Tormented Soul's previously-empty hands, the Tormented Staff not only changed the animation of Leshrac's Split Earth ability, but also introduced completely new animations for attacking, spawning, teleport completion, and death.",
"Cauldron of Xahryx of Eminent Revival": "Claimed by Sylla from the horned Xahryx before The International 2013, this vile cauldron was given a new animation for Entangling Claws, and was the final indicator of the path that all future Immortals would follow.",
"Pyrexaec Flux": "For the children who live in the underground caverns of the Riverwarren, the Day of Pyres is filled with stories and celebrations of a noble dragon protector who long ago descended from the surface world to help the Riverwarren's people in a time of great need. As the children get older, dreams of the dragon's return will assuredly fade, and attentions turn to fine spirits and foolhardy flame play, but for a time their young minds will grasp the truth.",
"Zeal of Omoz Arkosh": "To the lord of the seven dark dominions, the rush of power from consuming a lesser foe is nothing in the shadow of luxuriating in the pain of its passing.",
"Arcanic Resonance Beam": "Prepare for full arcanic reversal!",
"Shadow of the Dark Age":"Though long perished of form, some spiritual remnants of Balanar's lost brethren still haunt the edges of the void, drawn to the dark focus of their remaining One.",
"Warden of the Hellborn":"Even those demons he cannot bring directly to heel must fear the lashing shackles that spring from Lannik's fervent verse.",
"Dark Maw Inhibitor":"Though the craftsmanship and melding of his design seemed flawless, it was only too late that the erstwhile enchanter's apprentice realized the intended controlling agent of his muzzle hadn't bound itself to the device during his ritual – not at all.",
"Prominence":"There are rites too old even to be called rituals, too fundamental to be grasped by the mortal mind. Only in the inherent actions of the ageless ones can the patterns of the universe be tangentially observed, and perchance understood.",
"Fate of Hydrophiinae":"Each invocation of her ancestral power finds Medusa one measure further from her life's forgone — if not forgotten — path.",
"Blossom of the Merry Wanderer":"There are many theories amongst the \"munclane\" fae regarding the true nature of Faerie Dragons. Entire careers have been founded, fortunes made, and families embrassed in pursuit of the subject. And a Revtel party is hardly complete without much pontification on the finer points of the one known as Puck.",
"The Abscesserator":"Because why should you limit the gibs n' juice to just your chin?",
"Vigil Odyssey":"Though he spurns their company and their cause, a small band of Vigil-in-exile have sworn allegiance to Sven -- their \"Rogue Commander\" -- and seek to use what little influence they still possess to return to the Vigil Keep and take control of the remnants of the waning order.",
"Eyes of Ardenok":"Many magnoceroi believe the spirit of Ardenok, consort of the First Matriarch, refused passage through the Narrow Maze, and that for some unknown, terrible price, he can still be summoned to lend his strength from beyond the grave.",
"Fin of the First Spear":"For centuries, attempting to don this helm was a rite of passage to all who became First Spear of the Flood. In most cases, it was a short lesson in humility. In others, however, it meant a trip to the healer or even the grave. For one to wear the helm in battle like legends of old signals to Slithereen everywhere that a new age of strength is now upon them.",
"Scale of Bitter Spoil":"Given his abiding distaste for negotiations, barter, and population centers in general, Jah'rakal must display rare restraint with his axework when he decides to acquire something nice.",
"Awaleb's Trundleweed":"As Awaleb's destructive powers grew, so too did the influence of his healing touch. Indeed, one only need look for flourishing lands and overgrown fauna to follow the path of his great atrocities.",
"Aspect of Oscilla":"Though the Orbs of Oscilla had garnered intense study and spurred divisive debate spanning entire epochs of arcane methodology, Nortrom was the first to posit that these artifacts were no mere items of power, but astral appendages of some great creature, each of which might be used to locate further pieces of a terrifying whole.",
"Pyrexaec Forge":"Shunned and sometimes hunted by the other Pyrexae, Jakiro has honed the fury of the outcast and the guile of the survivor into a force capable of destroying dragons, demons, and all manner of creature in between.",
"Dipper the Destroyer":"The orphaned cub of a fierce tribe, even the ursine prophesies of old speak of this little guy's reign of destruction to come. Better make friends while you have the chance.",
"Perversions of the Bloodwhorl":"There was no prize in life Ethreain coveted more than the Bloodwhorl Crown, rumors of which drove him from kingdom to kingdom on a merciless hunt, and eventually to his mortal demise. Little did he know that no living creature may wear the crown, and had his quest succeeded before failing first, it would have proven his greatest failure of all.",
"Sagas of the Cymurrin Sage":"Some amongst the Advisors to the shattered Seat of Cymurri accepted their fates without fear or anger, or complicity in Nerif's banishment. They accepted the easily beheld truth that their own decline was necessary to ensure the sanctity of their beliefs, for there was no doubting the words of an Oracle compared against the vile hearts of those with power.",
"Rabid Watchcog":"As the full scale of his opposition's strength became clear, Clockwerk set about procuring whatever meagre enchantment help was available in order to augment the effectiveness of his arms and armor. Hopefully the second attempt turns out a bit more...stable.",
"Eye of Ix'yxa":"Distrustful especially of those he allows a measure of power or other favor, Ix'yxa sends an aspect of himself to watch over each cunning investment.",
"Stuntwood Symbiont":"If a host tree survives the stuntwood's parasite stage, and the sproutlings choose to bond with it, their tendrils develop an alternate source of nutrients that nourish tree and vine alike.",
"Solar Gyre":"Long separated from the matching headpiece, these relics were unearthed by a playful dragon toad in some corner of one desert or another--the dragon toad in question isn't so good with names--only regaining their shine when his friend traded them away to their surprisingly-shrewd rightful owner.",
"Crucible of Rile":"The Crucible of Rile both feeds upon and fuels the anger of any who don it. Always found upon a melted husk surrounded by a mess of corpses and viscera, it has never once passed between two pair of living hands.",
"Maraxiform's Fate":"If Clinkz must face the indignities of endless torment, the expired visage of that torment's origin would be made to bear witness as well.",
"Scythes of Sorrow":"Lost to him in the final trial before his banishment to Foulfell, the reclamation of these scythes represents the penultimate step on Terrorblade's return to demonic glory. Only one aspect of his plan remains unfinished. The worlds of demon and man will soon know sorrow.",
"Bloodmayne Avenger":"Daring a mission to the sacked remnants of his family estate, Banehallow gathered enough scraps of precious metals and keepsakes to meet the enchanter's price and the demands of her ingredient list. When the fires of her forge had cooled and her spells were fully woven, Banehallow knew he'd found the last face his enemies would ever see.",
"Progenitor's Bane":"There are many who have long yearned in secret for the war that Mars now openly declares--including some amongst the race that first helped his father capture the thunderbolt and were willing to risk such a feat again.",
"First of the Flood":"Even for those Slithereen Guard skilled enough to be counted amongst the Centurion elite, few could hope to be called for induction into the ranks of the Flood. Slardar's initiation at a young age and his rapid rise to position of First Spear suggest he has barely skimmed the surface of his true depth.",
"Sullen Rampart":"In a lost corner of the underworld, endless damned souls scrape and claw to reach the top of their unfathomable mass, none comprehending that no such summit exists, and only by the whims of their tormentor himself might a chosen few briefly see the light of day again.",
"The Gates of Nothl":"There are some amongst the elders of Dezun who suspect their gifted young acolyte never fully returned from the Nothl Realm at all, for in his eyes they sense the disquiet of a half-remembered place and the terrors of their own testing.",
"Rectifier":"Sometimes a happy little accident in the lab leads to great big breakthroughs on the battlefield.",
"Fortune of the Five Houses":"Once he had gained mastery over his spectral kin and returned to Ashkavor, Grimstroke claimed as final prize a brush imbued with magic from the most ancient and venerated bloodlines of his people, forged in the early days of the city before the advent of the Ascended Ones.",
"Chalice of Ix'yxa":"The Nether Reaches teem with baleful life, none more fearsome than Ix'yxa the destroyer. Grown too corpulent from feasting to traverse known passages to our domain, Ix'yxa barters favors to those who might act as proxy in seeking a new path.",
"Umbral Glyph":"Demnok Lannik had gained mastery over many lesser demons, but the true devils mocked him. Perhaps with the Umbral Glyph in hand, he could at last teach them the wisdom of supplication.",
"Twilight Schism":"Though serenity now largely reigns in Selemene's prized domain, the political history of Nightsilver's denizens has been at times complicated and bloody.",
"Horns of the Betrayer":"Though his mind remains very much his own, Lion has found that each life he takes with his grafted limb further feeds the transfiguration of his flesh, even infusing some of his other magics with aspects of the demon.",
"Apogee of the Guardian Flame":"It was not only curiosity that drew the Burning Celestial to the mortal plane, but a small, foreboding sense that some larger conflict--greater even than that of the Ancients--may soon come to pass.",
"Dread Requisition":"Only an enchanter's forge can bring about such vile augmentations, but no sane enchanter would aid or trust a creature beholden to N'aix's awful desires. It was only with great difficulty N'aix was able to locate a disgraced enchanter's apprentice who held a useful interest in darker arts.",
"Mask of Mortis":"Each time Krobelus traversed beyond the veil revealed ever more complexities of the entities that call such a place home. While most seem unconcerned with the land of the living, some watch--and influence--the events of the material plane with deep interest.",
"Latticean Hierarchy":"Already of singular status amongst his kind, the zealot assassin's powers and influence grew even stronger with the introduction of the shimmering crystals to his hive.",
"Flight of Epiphany":"Only tentatively could Dragonus send tendrils of mystic thought out in search of the boundaries of his power's connection to the Skywrath scion, for a single false step would expose him and doom his efforts forever. It was with a careful, quiet joy that Dragonus discovered there are grey areas in his oath to the Nest of Thorns, and much like the emotions behind the creation of Scree'auk's Talon, loyalty to the progenitors is powerful haven for certain actions of ambiguous intent.",
"Infernal Menace":"Those who seek to lock horns with Bradwarden might take lesson from the examples he has made using pieces from some of his larger fallen foes.",
"Tormented Crown":"The spires of woe are nourished with each wave of Chronoptic energy that passes through Leshrac's warped mind.",
"Judgement of the Fallen":"Earthshaker cannot restore life to those who fell in the destruction of his sister earth, but he can use a fragment from her passing to mete out justice to those responsible for her demise.",
"Reaper's Wreath":"Few topside rangers have ever seen the magnificent bloom of a bloodroot tree -- a specimen found only in sanctified underground caverns where long ago battles of horrific violence were waged to determine the fate of all Drow kind -- fewer still would survive an intrusion upon such holy ground to collect materials meant to wage further war. In fact, only one steeped in the etiquette of the Drow themselves might know the proper supplication required to hew a branch and live to use it.",
"Tines of Tybara":"One of Gondar's first mentors, Tybara was the master of the single-strike execution. Surprisingly, she was also the hunter of choice for those who wanted unruly targets returned alive, give or take a few working parts.",
"Ice Blossom":"Even when her duties carry her away from the frigid bliss of Icewrack, Rylai holds the very seed of winter in her hands.",
"Monarch of the Sapphire Glen":"Long ago, before Nature's Prophet's seed was made to sprout, Verodicia imbued a sapphire gem with a spark of her essence, meant to be left behind in the wastes of a war-torn land so that the cycle of life might sooner return to a place bereft of it.",
"Wraithbinder":"Though unable to cross over of their own will, some types of wraith love nothing more than to consume the energies of the mortal plane. Because each shred of power they absorb manifests tenfold in their home realm, they gladly trade service to Zett for the access he grants to our world.",
"Mantle of the Whispered Bond":"Not even Lanaya understands the true motives of the Hidden Ones, but the secrets they've revealed have more than earned her trust and loyalty. And if the whispers amongst her fellow temple adherents can be believed, soon a day will come when the hidden masters step forward to make the grand picture clear.",
"Chaos Arbiter":"Though its ethereal edge remains, the physical form of this blade will continue to diminish until its bearer can reunite the escaped children of the progenitor realm.",
"Piscean Pulverizer":"Forged by the elder smith of his village to commemorate the frozen form of young Tusk's first makeshift punching bag, this metal mitt bears the legend of the Iron Fisht to shores near and far.",
"Pachyderm Powderwagon":"After a slight miscalculation resulted in the destruction of their trusty cart, Squee and Spleen began to scheme on non-lethal means of enticing a new floppy-eared friend to join their happy crew. Eventually, one subject even survived!"
